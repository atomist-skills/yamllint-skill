Get consistency across your YAML files.

-   Run [yamllint](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io) with the same consistent
    configuration across all of your projects
-   Also supports repository-specific yamllint configurations
-   Uses GitHub Checks with code-level annotations for linting rule violations

Enable the skill by providing an yamllint configuration, commit and push your
code changes, and then enjoy automatic linting and fixes!
